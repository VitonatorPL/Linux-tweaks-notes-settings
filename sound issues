or

STEP 1
You need to navigate to a certain folder, if the command succeed, you're good and you can proceed to STEP 2, otherwise, refer to STEP 1.1

Here's the command:
cd /etc/pipewire

STEP 1.1
You don't have the folder, so here's the command to fix that:
sudo mkdir pipewire

STEP 2
You're going to create the folder "pipewire.conf.d"
sudo mkdir pipewire.conf.d

Now you need to navigate into it:
cd pipewire.conf.d

STEP 3
You need to create a file called "pipewire.conf".
Here you can write the thing that will only change one parameter: the minimum quantum value!

Be ready to copy-paste the long thing, but it'll be easy, don't worry.

Let's create the file with the entire stuff in it!

echo "context.properties = {default.clock.min-quantum = 1024}" | sudo tee pipewire.conf

If you followed everything correctly, just restart your computer and you'll be fine!
