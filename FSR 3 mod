## Regular FSR2FSR3 installation  
1. Find out which version of FSR2 the game uses.  
You can do this by checking the list of games that support high fidelity upscaling on [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List_of_games_that_support_high-fidelity_upscaling).  
NOTE: Certain games (Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart) use a different implementation of FSR2, but might also be listed as using version 2.2 on the wiki.  
You can detect these by looking for a file called `ffx_fsr2_x64.dll` in the game directory.  
If your game has that file in its game directory, please use the *SDK* version of the mod.

2. Select the mod corresponding to the FSR2 version.  
2.0.x -> `_200`  
2.1.x -> `_210`  
2.2.x or (N/A) -> `_220`  
SDK -> `_SDK`

3. Navigate to your game executable.  
For most games this should be in the root game directory, but also check the Notes section for your game's compatibility list entry for any specific directory you might need to use instead.  
For Unreal Engine games, you should use the executable ending with `-Shipping.exe`, which should be in a subdirectory. Do **not** use the executable found in the root game directory!

4. Extract the downloaded mod archive into the folder with the game executable.

5. Launch the game. If everything worked correctly, there should be a new console window with a few log messages and FSR3 working once you enable FSR2 (or DLSS) in select games.

## Notes
- **If you are on linux,** you need to add an environment variable `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winmm=n,b"` to get the mod to work.
    - For Steam games you can do that by adding `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winmm=n,b" %COMMAND%` into your launch parameters in game properties.
